# ToDo List with MySQL

This Python script is a basic command-line to-do list application that utilizes a MySQL database to store tasks. It supports adding new tasks, marking tasks as done, deleting tasks, and displaying all tasks. Users interact with the application through a series of prompts allowing them to manage their to-do list effectively. The script showcases fundamental database operations (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete) in Python using the `mysql.connector` library. 

Features include:
- Add tasks with a simple text prompt.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete specific tasks by ID.
- View all tasks in a list format.
- Clear all tasks from the list.

This project is suitable for those learning about database integration with Python and basic CRUD operations.
